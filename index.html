        However they also write that increasing commodity prices are having an impact on prices in the near term.
      </p>
      <p>
        The survey looks at battery packs and battery cells for electric vehicles, buses and energy storage projects. Battery pack prices were lowest in China at $111 per kWh, prices in US and EU were 40 to 60&percnt; higher.
      </p>
      <p>
        BloombergNEF also says: "...by 2024 average pack prices should be below $100/kWh. 
        It is at around this price point that automakers should be able to produce and sell mass-market EVs at the same price 
        (and with the same margin) as comparable internal combustion vehicles in some markets"

            There is a cap on the number of allowances in the market. 
            The number of allowances is reduced over time, forcing a reduction in emissions.

          <p>
          The chart shows LCOE (levelized cost of electricity) for new installations in 2021 and 2030, in NOK per kWh. LCOE is the cost per kWh for the entire lifetime of a new electricity generating plant, and includes investments, operations and fuels.

          <p>
          Onshore wind is currently the least expensive energy source for new installations, and will continue to decrease in cost dramatically over the next decade.
          Perhaps surprisingly, even in Norway solar photovoltaic ground installations are becoming competitive and will be less expensive than all other electricity sources except for onshore wind.

        <h4>March 2, 2021</h4>
        <p>
          A 2019 report from Eindhoven University 2019 shows that battery electric cars have significantly lower CO2
          emissions compared to similar fossil-fueled cars over their lifetime using the EU electricity mix.
        <p>
          The report assumes that the cars are driven 250.000 km in their lifetime.
        <p>
          The report assumes an EU electricity mix is used, but also that this electricity mix will continue its trend
          towards lower CO2 emissions. The Polestar report below does not make this assumption, and probably
          overestimates the emissions of electric cars.

            <h4>March 1, 2021</h4>
            <p>
          In their own 2019 report, Polestar says that the Polestar 2 BEV (battery electric vehicle)
          has lower CO2 emissions during its lifetime than a Volvo XC40 ICE (internal combustion engine).
        <p>
          Assumptions in the report: Cars are driven 200.000 km in their lifetime.
          Chinese electricity mix is used for Polestar 2 manufacturing.
          Polestar battery cells are manufactured in China and Korea.
          Emissions for the XC40 includes 'well-to-tank' related emissions for petrol/gasoline.
        <p>
          The report finds that if the electricity is generated by wind power then the Polestar
          generates less than half of the CO2 emissions of an XC40 petrol/gasoline powered car.
          If the electricity is generated using an EU electricity mix then the emissions savings over the lifetime of
          the car is about 27&percnt;

        million tons per year since 1990,
        emissions of perfluorocarbons (PFC) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) from the

        Emissions of hydrofluorocarbons (HFC) from air-con and cooling systems have increased,
        but this should be sharply reduced soon
        as new coolants with lower global warming potential is being used.

          be reduced in the future at the cost of higher global emissions,
