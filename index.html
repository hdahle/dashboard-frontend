        has looked at the number of deaths per TWh (terawatt-hour) of electricity
        generated from different sources.
        Data includes accidents and
        longer term effects due to pollution and radiation,
        but not results of CO2 emissions and global warming.
        <p>
          Coal is the deadliest power-generator with more than 32 deaths per TWh,
          mainly due to air pollution. This is 1000 times as many deaths as wind, hydro and solar.
          For the same amount of energy generated,
          even natural gas causes about 100 times as many deaths as renewable
          sources.

        <p>
          Nuclear power has a relatively low mortality rate,
          even when the Chernobyl and Fukushima accidents are included.
