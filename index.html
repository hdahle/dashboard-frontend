        but emissions will increase as more people move towards a higher standard of living.
        China, the country with the highest emissions in the world,

        Emissions of hydrofluorocarbons (HFC) from air-con and cooling systems have increased,

          GISTEMPv4 dataset from NASA
        </a>
        shows that the earth is now about 1&deg; hotter

        According to NASA, 2019 was the second hottest year since measurements began in 1880.
        As the chart indicates, the hottest year recorded is 2016.

        <h2>Arctic temperatures increasing dramatically: +5&deg; since 1900</h2>
        Data from The Norwegian Meteorological Institute and
        The Norwegian Centre for Climate Services indicate that temperatures in the Arctic,
        as measured at Svalbard Airport (78.24 degrees North), are now at least 5&deg;C higher than 50-100 years
        ago.
        The increased temperature in the Arctic leads to thawing of the permafrost,
        which in turn releases CO2 and methane currently trapped in the permafrost.

          INPE, Brazil's National Institute for Space Research.

        INPE monitors forest fire activity in Latin America on a daily basis using satellite imagery.
        This chart shows each month of 2019 plotted against
        the monthly averages in the period 1999 to 2018.
        2019 has seen less than average fire activity.
        <p>
          The data is a measure of fire activity, but not the exact number of fires per month.
          When a satellite image indicates an area with fire activity,
          there might actually be more than one fire within that image pixel.
          Also, a single forest fire may span several pixels.

        <h2>Carbon Capture and Storage: CCS creates more CO2 than it captures</h2>
        According to
        <a href="https://www.globalccsinstitute.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
          Global CCS Institute
        </a>
        there are 19 large-scale CCS projects in operation as of end-of-2019,
        capturing 38 million tons CO2 annually
        (less than 0.1&percnt; of global CO2 emissions).
        <p>
          Most of the captured CO2 (30 million tons) is used for EOR - Enhanced Oil Recovery:
          Injection of CO2 into oil wells in order to extract more oil.
          <a href="https://www.iea.org/commentaries/can-co2-eor-really-provide-carbon-negative-oil" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener">
            IEA
          </a>
          estimates that this accounts for an extra 500.000 barrels of oil per day.
          This equals 78 million tons CO2 emissions per year.
          In other words, CCS generates an extra 40 million tons of CO2 emissions annually.

        The chart lists all CCS projects as of 2019. Those in red color use captured CO2 for EOR.
