        <h2>Atmospheric CO2 levels are increasing</h2>
        The level of CO2 in the atmosphere over the last 800.000 years has fluctuated between 180 and 280 ppm (parts per
        million).
        Since the industrial revolution this level has increased rapidly and is currently at around 410 ppm.
        This chart is updated monthly.
        <p>
          Notice the saw-tooth pattern in the chart:
          This is due to seasonal variations in photo-synthesis:
          There is more land-mass and more greenery in the Northern
          hemisphere than in the Southern hemisphere,
          therefore the earth consumes more CO2 in the Northern summer.
          In the winter season, more CO2 is released.

        CO2 emissions are still increasing, especially in Asia.

        While CO2 emissions have increased from 35 to almost 44
        million tons per year since 1990,
        the emissions of perfluorocarbons (PFC) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) mainly from the
        aluminum and magnesium industries are now close to 0.
        The emissions of hydrofluorocarbons (HFC) from air-con and cooling systems has increased,
        although this should be sharply reduced soon
        as new coolants with lower global warming potential is being used.

          Norwegian oil and gas production represents about
          27&percnt; of total emissions. These emissions are expected to
          be reduced in the future at the cost of higher global emissions,
          when on-shore hydroelectric power replaces off-shore gas turbines

          Most of the captured CO2 (30 million tons) is used for EOR - Enhanced Oil Recovery:
          Injection of CO2 into oil wells in order to extract more oil.

          estimates that this accounts for an extra 500.000 barrels of oil per day.
          This equals 78 million tons CO2 emissions per year.
          In other words, CCS generates an extra 40 million tons of CO2 emissions annually.

        The chart lists all CCS projects in use.
        Those with a red color use the captured CO2 for EOR.
